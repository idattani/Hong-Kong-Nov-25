The arm was placed over a permanently-fixed metal pole inside the tank and was rotated at 180 degrees along the height of the tank to remove asphalt that had solidified on the walls.  The arm was moved horizontally by the force of the water and two coworkers inside the tank using guide ropes to move the arm across the face of the wall interior.  The arm moved vertically up the height of the tank by means of a hand-operated winch located outside the tank and affixed to the arm by means of a wire rope.  A coworker on the exterior of the tank hoisted the arm by slowly winching the wire rope back onto the spindle of the hoist.  The water and asphalt debris were removed from the tank floor using a nozzle attached to a vacuum truck.  The employee and coworkers reportedly stood on the opposite side of the 180 degree radius of the hydroblast arm but the wire rope broke and the arm struck Employee #1 on the head.  Visibility in the tank prevented the coworkers in the tank from actually witnessing what had happened but it was speculated that Employee #1 had moved under the arm in an attempt to keep it from falling.

The employer bought and sold scrap metals and other items in southern California. The facility where the employee worked was a large commercial open or outdoor yard. It had a receiving area where pieces of metal scrap from the petrochemical and other industries were brought in and processed. The facility also had an office building and an indoor machine shop shed area. The employee was working as a permanent, full-time employee at the time of the incident. The yard supervisor, who was also the employee's immediate supervisor, was at the yard at the time of the incident. The employee was using a Victor oxygen and propane gas open flame cutting torch. It was attached to a 22.8-meter (75-foot) hose line, color-coded red for fuel and green for oxygen. He was in an outdoor area, in the northeast part of the yard facility. Immediately prior to the incident, the employee had torch-cut several metal pipes lying in the area. He then began cutting a Hydril pulsation dampener. The spherical pulsation dampener consisted of two sections held together by 36 stud bolts. The employee began torch-cutting along the seam. This action caused the buildup of ignitable or flammable vapors within the dampener. He had cut 12 of the 36 stud bolts, when the dampener exploded. The vapors had caught fire, and the dampener ripped apart along the seam. The employee sustained multiple bodily fractures, a laceration to his abdomen, an injury to his left shoulder, and ruptures in the skin of his left upper and lower leg. The paramedics transported the employee to the medical center, for treatment. Surgeries were performed. Later on, he was hospitalized in Loma Linda University Medical Center, and he was discharged on March 29, 2017. The firm's manager of operations and safety compliance reported the incident to the San Bernardino District Office at 1:10 p.m. on January 9, 2017. The employer reported the serious injury accident in a timely manner and met the Division's reporting requirements. An inspector from the District office arrived at the facility and opened an inspection with the firm's owner and the employer's attorney at approximately 8:45 a.m on January 10, 2017. During the interview, the employee stated that the firm's owner had assigned him the job of torch cutting all materials to be cut, including the pulsation dampener. It was thought that the employer had failed to make certain that the pulsation dampener did not contain any hazardous flammable substance or could build up pressure that would render it unsafe during salvage operations. Such operations would have included open flame torch cutting, crushing, and cutting by shear machines.

The boiler truck had a foot controller with a pressure switch originally on the truck when it came from the manufacturer.  The employer did an in house modification of the hydraulic control for the roller and added a hand lever switch.  This switch had been overridden by a bungee cord which caused the roller to continue spinning.

There was no means to cut the power to the hydraulic roller on the elevated work platform at the point of operation during operating cycles.

A demolition contractor was demolishing a multiple story coal energy plant.  After performing necessary cuts on the structural steel on multiple floors, the plan was for the company to pull the bottom columns out and a large section of the building would collapse.  The company made cuts to the columns at the bottom, top, and a notch about 6 feet off of the floor.  The company then attached wire ropes to each of the columns and used an excavator to pull the wire ropes one at a time to the exterior of the building until that section of the building collapsed.  On June 24, 2016, the company successfully pulled one column down, but when pulling on the second column the wire rope broke.  After connecting a new wire rope and pulling again, the second wire rope broke.  At around 11:00 a.m., multiple employees went into the building to make additional cuts to the columns. After one of the columns was recut, the superintendent used a sledge hammer to hit the column multiple times.  After striking the column a few times, it broke at the notch and fell down.  The upper part of the column struck the superintendent in the abdomen.  He was transported to the hospital and died that day from multiple abdominal injuries.
